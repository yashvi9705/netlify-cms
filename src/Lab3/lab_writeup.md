## Comparison of Serverless Function Providers

##  Netlify Functions
   
   - Strengths: Offers simple integration with Netlify-hosted sites, making deployment of serverless functions straightforward. It supports JavaScript and TypeScript. Provides a free tier suitable for light use.
   - Use Cases: Great for small-to-medium web applications or static sites with dynamic functionality.
   - Limitations: Primarily geared towards Netlify users and less flexible for broader integrations.

## AWS Lambda  
   - Strengths: Supports multiple languages (like Node.js, Python, Java), with excellent integration across AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. Automatically scales based on workload.
   - Use Cases: Ideal for event-driven applications, APIs, and large-scale applications requiring robust backend support.
   - Limitations: More complex setup compared to others, and pricing may escalate with high usage.

##  Google Cloud Functions
   - Strengths: Focused on event-driven execution, with tight integration into Google Cloud services like Cloud Pub/Sub and Firestore. Offers efficient deployment and monitoring via Stackdriver.
   - Use Cases: Well-suited for real-time applications or teams already using Google Cloud.
   - Limitations: Fewer features compared to AWS Lambda and limited to Google’s ecosystem.

##  Azure Functions
   - Strengths: Integrates deeply with the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, supports a variety of languages, and includes unique features like Durable Functions for managing workflows.
   - Use Cases: Excellent for teams using Azure services or applications with complex workflows.
   - Limitations: Strongly tied to Azure services, which can limit portability.


#### For hosting the serverless function, I used Netlify Functions because it’s simple to set up, integrates seamlessly with static sites, and also has a free tier which was perfect for smaller projects. If I needed more scalability or advanced cloud integrations, I would prefer suing  AWS Lambda as a backup.
